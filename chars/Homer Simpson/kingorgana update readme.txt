I was in the midst of making my own minor edit to the Team S.M.R.T. Homer Simpson until I stumbled
upon this lovely gem. With the approval of The 14th Doctor, I have decided to do a minor overhaul to
this version of the classic MUGEN character we've grown to love and hate.

========================
Version History:
(As of November 7, 2017)
========================

v2.5 (November 7, 2017) (by KingOrgana)
- CHANGED: Homer's DBZ intro now better utilizes the DBZ sprites from Warner's Homero, as well as
           matching the timing set to match GigaBowserX's original intro.
           Homer's DBZ intro also now works against other DBZ characters that utilize the CHOUJIN-
           style (i.e. stig87, Tomo, etc).

{{{Footnote}}}~ There is a CHOUJIN-style Goku Black by Heal The World that exists, as well as
                plenty of others that I am likely unaware of; I would recommend editing the "author
                name" in Goku Black's DEF file to "CHOUJIN" if you choose to use the intro against
                the character.

***HARD DRIVE BECAME CORRUPTED NOVEMBER 7, 2017***
(Thankfully I had this project saved on a backup hard drive. My IT buddy DBaN'd the original
hard drive and installed Linux for me, and now I'm using Wine and PlayOnLinux for Fighter Factory and MUGEN (yes, they work with Wine and PlayOnLinux).

v2.5 (continued) (November 12, 2017) (by KingOrgana)
- ADDED: New 9000,1 portrait I created.
- FIXED: Peter's color palette for Homer's intro against the former.
- ADDED: Intro against Giant Chicken, which emulates Judgespear's intro created for his "Giant
         Chicken vs Homer Simpson?" video as seen on YouTube (edited some of those sprites of
         Peter for this intro, myself). The very ending utilizes the existing intro against
         Warner's Big Chicken.
         Also added the appropriate sound effects neccessary for the intro.
- FIXED: Crash clatter sound effect used in the Strong Man intro (basically found a clean
         version online {Google is your friend ;)}.

The 14th Doctor for this wonderful edit of the classic character.
